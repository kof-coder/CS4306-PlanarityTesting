1. Hopcroft & Tarjan (1974)

   The 1974 Hopcroft and Tarjan paper fixed the big open problem in graph theory: how to check in linear time if a given graph was planar. Preceding that, many of the planarity test algorithms took much longer to run and weren't very useful for very large graphs. Their algorithm employs a depth-first search to explore the graph and maintains the structure in biconnected components as it looks for edge crossings. The essential insight is to exploit the information in the DFS tree, such as the low points and the back edges, to set up local planarity conditions as the exploration unfolds.
   The upshot was a linear-time algorithm, O(V), which is the best possible in theory for this problem. It not only can tell whether a given graph is planar, but can also, given that it is, produce a planar embedding. The techniques in the paper later became the foundation for subsequent work in the field of graph algorithms, underpinning everything from planarity tests to current graph drawing and visualization techniques.

2. CLRS Planarity Chapter

   This chapter covers the properties of planar graphs and how to determine planarity in an efficient manner. It relies on essential graph theory findings such as Kuratowski's theorem and describes how algorithmic checks for planarity can be performed based on DFS. The chapter stresses the interplay among the theory of planar graphs and the practical computational algorithm, how the graphs can be embedded non-crossingly under certain structural conditions. It shows the Hopcroft-Tarjan algorithm as the standard solution and addresses why the algorithm runs in linear time, and why that is optimal because all edges of the graph must be examined. The presentation also covers how to construct planar embeddings, how the abstractions of planarity map onto practical problems like circuit layouts and network visualization, and how the structure of planar graphs can serve algorithmic design in an efficient manner.

3. Di Battista et al. (Graph Drawing)

   In this book, it addresses the problem of rendering graphs in a transparent and meaningful manner. The book starts at the level of planarity testing and then moves step by step toward the more general subject of how to obtain readable and efficient layouts of graphs. The authors cover several algorithm classes, including planar embeddings, orthogonal drawings, hierarchical arrangements, and force-directed methods. What matters most is the trade-off of mathematical accuracy against visual clarity.

   From the standpoint of complexity, the text covers both efficient and slow, typically O(n²) or worse, methods. Most of the planar embedding algorithms can be performed in near-linear or linear time, while the force-directed and optimization-based layouts are very slow, typically O(n²) or worse. The text is seminal in that it connects the theoretical foundation of planarity and the graph's structure to the practical visualization and analysis algorithms.
